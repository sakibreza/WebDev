                    <h2><u>C/C++</u></h2>
                    C is the first programming language I've learned.Currently I'm solving different programming problems in various programming platforms/online judges.
                    I've already solved 100+ beginners' programming problem in URI Online Judge & also solving problems on other OJs like- Codechef,CodeForces,Timus,LightOJ,UVa.
                    nowadays I feel comfortable coding with both C & C++ while solving problems.</br>
                    
                    <h2><u>HTML/CSS</u></h2>
                    I've started learning HTML5 along with CSS3 for the purpose of Web Developing.I'm enhancing my developing skill day by day.The site you're now browsing is my
                    first personal project with HTML5/CSS3.</br>

                    <h2><u>User Expert (research)</u></h2>
                    I think this is my natural skill.I've already unveiled couple of project with my team 'Progworms' which were based on some practical problems.On both occasion I've personally identified 
                    the exact problems & the requirements of our users.And I've guided my team properly with my observance & research to come up with an user friendly project.That's why 
                   our users/clients were very much satisfied with our projects.</br> 

                   <h2><u>Graphics Designing</u></h2>
                   Actually,That's none of my real jobs. Still I'm comfortable enough to use Adobe-PS/GIMP to support my works.</br>
